    <p>SunshinePHP is made possible by the generous contributions of sponsors. The
        conference is organized by developers for developers. So we strive to keep
        the event as easy to attend as possible and make it the best experience
        possible for attendees of all skill and economic levels.  In order to accomplish
        this we heavily rely on the financial support of the awesome folks listed below.</p>
